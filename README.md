# Chat-Server-With-Multiple-Clients
A basic chat server with multiple clients in it simultaneously

# How to compile correctly!
Make sure server is running first then run the client program. 

# Bugs!
In order for client to exit the chat server, the user has to type "bye" in a single line. Additionally that "bye" message should broadcast to every other user. However, sometime it does and sometimes it doesn't.
